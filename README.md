# Priorit: Prioritize Your Tasks!

I remember being completely unsure of where I should go next. I became demotivated during that period because I had no idea what I could do to achieve my goal. I've found that it's pointless to dwell on what went wrong; instead, I must motivate myself and begin doing something that will help me achieve my goal.

As a result, I begin to make a list of things I should be doing and prioritize them based on what is feasible and necessary to achieve my objectives.

I sometimes get overwhelmed because I may have listed just too much things to do. I recall reviewing certain tasks in order to help me sort out unnecessary task(s). I gradually felt better because I unintentionally broke down my tasks and began completing them in order of priority.
